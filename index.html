    <div class="text">
        <p>I am a programmer, I develop websites. In November 2018, I was approached by a German
            startup.
            We
            discussed the terms and agreed that they would transfer the payment in dollars to me on check.
            Before that,
            I
            had never worked with foreign exchange. I thought the client would just make a regular bank transfer
            to my
            card.
            It turned out, before the money can be used, it must go through currency control.</p>

    <h2>What is currency control</h2>

    <div class="text">
        <p>In Russia, all foreign exchange transactions are subject to the Law on Foreign Exchange
            Regulation and Foreign Exchange control. From buying currency in an exchange office to making
            settlements
            with foreign companies - all this foreign exchange transactions, and they must be accounted for by
            the
            state.</p>
        <p>When a payment comes from abroad, the Government and the Central Bank must be sure that
            the
            money obtained legally. They ask the recipient for documents that will confirm that he received
            payment for
            a legal product or service, and not for the sale of weapons, organizing a terrorist attack or
            illegal deal.
            The process of verifying the legality of the money received is called foreign exchange control.</p>
        <p>To speed up currency controls, the Central Bank allows commercial banks to check the
            legality of
            payments. Employees of the bank that received the payment check all confirming documents, and then
            transfer
            all information to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.</p>
